# moozek-controller
Moozek is a free collaborative social music webapp that will offer a “quick, simple, and highly collaborative” music-making experience which 
can be highly customised with a separate room where you can even add your friends and jam together.

This project is all about listening to music in sync with friends or groups. We can create rooms and add our friends to enjoy music in sync and 
so that everyone in that room can manage it through their phones.
